Welcome
=======

* This environment is only to access files and setup websites. It is NOT the
  environment that the website will actually run in.
* The webroot is "/srv/public", it will look for "index.php" then "index.html".
* If MySQL is enabled, it will be available on host "mysql" NOT "localhost".

* This environment is completely isolated and could disappear and/or get reset
  at any time (when the system decides to install updates, etc).
  When this happens, anything outside the "/srv" directory will be LOST.
   - The "/srv" directory is the ONLY directory mounted to permanent storage.

* The template used to create this environment can be found at "/usr/share/srv".
  The CURRENT configuration for this environment is "/root/docker-compose.yaml".
* If you want to customise the environment, submit your Dockerfiles and Compose
  config to be run.
